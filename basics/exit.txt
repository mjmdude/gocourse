package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("Deferred Statement")
	fmt.Println("Starting the main function")
	// Exit with status code of 1
	os.Exit(1)
	// This will not run
	fmt.Println("End of main function")
}

// os.exit exits go immediately w/out performing any cleanup operations.  No defer functions are run.
// Use Cases:
////Error handling
////Termination conditions
////Exit Codes
// Best Practices
////Avoid Deferred Actions
////Status Codes.  Use meaningfu status codes.  0 == Successful
////Avoide Abuse.  Use when program must be stopped immediately.
